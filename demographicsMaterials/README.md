# Materials for the examples using COVID-19 demographic data
We provide two Jupyter notebooks:
- [covid_PCA.ipynb](covid_PCA.ipynb): Python code reproducing the examples used in the article
- [covid_NonLinear.ipynb](covid_NonLinear.ipynb): Python code reproducing the examples used in the article
The data necessary to run the examples is provided in the [covid_processed.csv]() file
Additionally, the Jupyter notebook [covid_PCA_exercises.ipynb](covid_PCA_exercises.ipynb) is a "blank" version of the original notebook with annotations in which the students are asked to reproduce the PCA examples using Python.
