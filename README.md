# Demystifying Dimensionality Reduction Techniques in the 'Omics' Era: A Practical Approach for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Students

This repository contains teacher & student materials accompanying the article "Demystifying Dimensionality Reduction Techniques in the 'Omics' Era: A Practical Approach for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Students" (link pending publication).

The article describes a series of examples based on demographic data and single cell transcriptomics (on the sc/ folder) that we found useful for teaching concepts and applied methods of dimensionality reduction to students from non-mathematical backgrounds.

# COVID-19 demographics examples
We propose to use a very simple dataset with demographic data from the COVID-19 pandemic to illustrate PCA and non-linear dimensionality reduction.
## Materials
We provide [a Jupyter notebook for the PCA examples](https://github.com/Leo-GG/DimRed_tutorial/blob/main/Exercises/countries_PCA_exercises.ipynb) that contains annotations and examples for the students.
A second notebook contains the code to reproduce the examples demonstrating non-linear methods presented in the paper.
## Data
The data is provided in [a small .csv file hosted in this repository](https://github.com/Leo-GG/DimRed_tutorial/blob/main/Exercises/covid_processed.csv) 

# Single-cell transcriptomics examples
We suggested to use single-cell or single-nuclei data to illustrate the same concepts using a larger, more complex dataset.
## Materials
We provide Jupyter notebooks that reproduce the examples presented in the article [on PCA]() and on [non-linear methods]()
## Data 
The scRNA-seq data for these examples is provided in a loom file hosted on [Figshare](https://figshare.com/projects/Dimensionality_Reduction_Tutorial/151215)
